## About The Project

This project used Create-React-App to build an application which allows users to see lists of quotes on the topics of Hope, Leadership, Inspiration, Comedy, or any topic of the user's choosing. Quotes can be saved to viewe later and are sorted by styles and colors. Throughout the project, learning goals included:

- Architect an application structure using functional components and hooks
- Solidify competency with React fundamentals and state management
- Effiecient time managenemnt on solo made app 
- Working with React Hooks & asynchronous JS using Cypress testing
- Create a multi-page UX using Router
- Using the FavQ's API.
- Deployment using Heroku

- [Deployed app](https://inspire-finder.herokuapp.com)
- [Project Brief and Rubric](https://frontend.turing.edu/projects/module-3/niche-audience.html)


#### Built With:

- React
- React Router
- ES6
- HTML5
- CSS
- Cypress
- FavQ's api


## Set-up Instructions

1. Additionally you can clone down the repo [here](https://github.com/Max9545/inspire-finder)
2. Move into the gallery-time directory in your terminal.
3. To see the code itself locally, run `<name of text editor> .`

- visit http://localhost:3000/
- will need a FavQ's api key

## Learning Goals

- Deeper understanding of React fundamentals including components, props, state, JSX, hooks.
- End to End testing using Cypress
- Refactoring an application to utilize React Router
- Deploying an application on Heroku
- Utilize PWA to run application offline.


## Challenges

1. Planning: intentionally planning an overall strategy before writing code. This included component structures and state if applicable
2. Using Cypress testing, to implement E2E testing and throughly test all user flows including stubbing api calls
3. Using the FavQ's Api with an Authorization Token.

## Wins

1. Implementing the MVP in a timely and efficient manner
2. Improvement of Cypress testing methodologies 
3. Mobile first design.
4. Dynamic rendering of components on multiple levels
